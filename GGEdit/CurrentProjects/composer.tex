\textbf{Hyperledger Composer} is an open development toolset to make it simple and fast to create smart contracts and blockchain applications to solve business problems.  
The main goal is to make it easier to integrate blockchain applications with existing business systems, and thus accelerate time-to-value. 

Composer can help develop use cases and deploy a blockchain solution in weeks, rather than months. 

With Composer, users can quickly model an existing business network, and integrate existing systems and data with blockchain applications. 
A network can contain assets---such as tangible or intangible goods, services, or property---and transactions related to them. 
As part of the model, users can define how transactions can interact wit assets. 

Business networks include the participants who interact with them. And each participant can be associated with a unique identity across several different business networks.

Hyperledger Composer supports the existing \textbf{Hyperledger Fabric} blockchain infrastructure and runtime. 
Since Fabric supports pluggable consensus protocols, this ensures that transactions can be validated according to the policy of the appropriate network participants.
