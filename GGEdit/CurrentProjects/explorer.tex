\textbf{Hyperledger Explorer} provides a dashboard for viewing information about blocks, node logs, statistics, smart contracts, transactions, and any other information stored in the blockchain. 
Users can query for specific blocks or transactions to view the complete details. 

Explorer can be integrated with any authentication or authorization platforms, either commercial or open source, to provide the functions appropriate to the user's privileges. 

The goals of the Explorer project include:
\begin{itemize}
\item To create a web application for a generic blockchain explorer that's easy to install and can be used with different blockchain platforms
\item To use the latest tools and technologies to make Explorer easy to implement, maintain, and extend
\item To support the standard package managers available on most popular platforms to ensure the Explorer is quick and easy to install
\end{itemize}
