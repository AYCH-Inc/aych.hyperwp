\textbf{Hyperledger Burrow} provides a modular blockchain client with a permissioned smart contract interpreter developed partly to the specifications of the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). In short, Burrow is a permissionable smart contract machine. 

Burrow became the fourth distributed ledger platform under the Hyperledger umbrella in April, 2017. 
It was originally developed and proposed to Hyperledger by Monax.

Burrow provides a strongly deterministic, smart contract-focused blockchain design. Burrow users benefit from an access control layer through the use of smart contracts and €œsecure natives-based permission layer.

Burrow includes all the following components:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Consensus engine}---Maintains the networking stack between nodes and ordering transactions to be sed by the application engine.
\item \textbf{Application Blockchain Interface (ABCI)}---Provides the interface specification for the consensus engine and application engine to connect.
\item \textbf{Smart contract application engine}---Provides developers with a strongly deterministic smart contract engine for operating complex industrial processes.
\item \textbf{Gateway}---Provides programmatic interfaces for system integrations and user interfaces.
\end{itemize}
