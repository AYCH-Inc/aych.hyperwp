Hyperledger Iroha joined Fabric and Sawtooth Lake to become the third distributed ledger platform under the Hyperledger umbrella in October, 2016. It was originally developed by Soramitsu in Japan and was proposed to the Hyperledger Project by Soramitsu, Hitachi, NTT Data, and Colu.

Iroha takes a very different design philosophy from Fabric and Sawtooth Lake, in that it focuses on providing features that are helpful for creating applications for end-users.
