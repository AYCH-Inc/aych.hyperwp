Hyperledger Fabric is a platform for distributed ledger solutions, underpinned by a modular architecture delivering high degrees of confidentiality, resiliency, flexibility and scalability. It is designed to support pluggable implementations of different components, and accommodate the complexity and intricacies that exist across the economic ecosystem.

Where Hyperledger Fabric differs from some other blockchain systems is that it is private and permissioned. Rather than allowing anyone to be part of the network by either participating in the Proof-of-Work consensus or receiving transferrable forms of data such as tokens over the blockchain, the members of a Hyperledger Fabric network enroll through a membership services provider.

Hyperledger Fabric also offers the ability to create channels, allowing a group of participants to create a separate ledger of transactions. This is an especially important option for networks where some participants might be competitors and not want every transaction they make, such as a special price they're offering to some participants and not others, known to every participant in the network. If two participants form a channel, then only those participants, and no others, have copies of the ledger for that channel.
