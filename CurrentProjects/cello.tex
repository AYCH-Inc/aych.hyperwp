Hyperledger Cello aims to bring the on-demand “as-a-service” deployment model to the blockchain ecosystem to reduce the effort required for maintaining the lifecycle of implementations of Hyperledger blockchain frameworks. It provides a multi-tenant chain service efficiently and automatically on top of various infrastructures, e.g., baremetal, virtual machine, and more container platforms, overall helping provide Blockchain as a Service efficiently. It also helps with maintenance through a dashboard where users can check the system status, scale the chain numbers, and change resources.
